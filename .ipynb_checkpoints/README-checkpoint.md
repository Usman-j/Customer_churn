- The paths and features list used by functions are present in [constants](constants.py).
- [tests](churn_script_logging_and_tests.py) can be run by using the following command ``ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`` in terminal. The models and results will be stored as per the paths in [constants](constants.py). The .log file containing results from running all tests will be stored in the logging path set in [tests](churn_script_logging_and_tests.py).
